Noah (M) is the child of Elijah (M),Wyx (F).

First,let me identify Noah's siblings - people who share the same parents:
- Wayne (M) is the child of Elijah (M),Wyx (F)
- Yolanda (F) is the child of Elijah (M),Wyx (F)

So Wayne is Noah's brother,therefore in the same generation.

To find others in the same generation,I need to look at the family tree structure. Since Noah's parents come from different generational levels (Elijah appears to be first generation with no listed parents,while Wyx is a grandchild),I'll focus on finding people at the same level of descent.

Looking at others who are children of the same parents or at equivalent family tree positions,the most direct answer for men in Noah's immediate generation would be his male siblings.

Rachel (F) is the child of Amy (F),Ivan (M).

To find Rachel's generation,I need to trace her parents:
- Ivan (M) - programmer - not listed as anyone's child,so Generation 1
- Amy (F) is the child of Ava (F),Zachary (M)
  - Ava (F) - not listed as anyone's child,so Generation 1  
  - Zachary (M) is the child of Bud (M),Eve (F) - both Generation 1,so Zachary is Generation 2
  - Amy is therefore Generation 3 (child of Gen 1,Gen 2)
- Rachel is Generation 4 (child of Gen 1,Gen 3)

Now I need to find all males who are also in Generation 4 - those who are children of parents from similar generational levels.

To find other women in the same generation,I need to identify other 4th generation women - those who are children of 3rd generation people.
